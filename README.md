# Proposal to Include Dedicated Elision Character for CJK Scripts

A response to [sparanoid/chinese-copywriting-guidelines#58](https://github.com/sparanoid/chinese-copywriting-guidelines/issues/58). We can’t agree on which ellipsis character to use. Let’s propose a new one!

(Just in case: This is a serious proposal. The character *is needed*, in my opinion.)
